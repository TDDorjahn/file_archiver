    .vscode (dir):
    - launch.json contain options for building in debug or release mode (default arg is "Makefile"):
        * (Debug) debug file_archiver
        * (Release) run file_archiver
    - settings.json:
        * cmake.buildDirectory: "${workspaceFolder}/build/${buildType}"
            ${buildType} comes from CMake Variant Selection.
        * cmake.buildBeforeRun: true
        * cmake.configureSettings: { "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "${buildType}" }
            sets cmake variable ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE} to Variant type.
    
    build (dir):
    - Added directories Debug and Release for their respective builds.
    - README's included in both directories for detailed build and run explanation.

    Build Process:
    - Added separate build processes for Debug and Release modes.
    - Common interface files (.hpp files) have been placed into interface/common/ under
      file_archiver_common library.
    - Component interface files have remained in interface/, but are under the file_archiver_interface library,
      which is linked with file_archiver_common library.
    - Source files under src/ are in library file_archiver_src, linking to file_archiver_interface.

    Before Building:
    - Make sure to have CMake version >=3.20 installed.
    - If using vscode, install CMake tools and the C/C++ and the C/C++ Extension Pack to make life easier.
    - If not, you'll have to set up cmake-kits.json and cmake-variants.yaml yourself
      to handle compiler settings, toolchain files, and give buildType and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE a value.

    Debug Build:
    - Select Debug Variant:
        * CMake Tools: Ctrl+Shift+P > CMake: Select Variant > Debug
        * Without CMT: create cmake-variants.yaml in root or IDE subdirectory for the project (for vscode, project subdirectory is .vscode/)

    cd build/Debug
    cmake ../..
    cmake --build . --config Debug

    Release Build:
    - Select Release Variant:
        * CMake Tools: Ctrl+Shift+P > CMake: Select Variant > Release
        * Without CMT: create cmake-variants.yaml in root or IDE subdirectory for the project (for vscode, project subdirectory is .vscode/)

    cd build/Release
    cmake ../..
    cmake --build . --config Release

    Running Builds:
        With vscode:
        - Go to Debugger side panel
        - From the Run and Debug dropdown menu, select desired build type.
            *Note: If you built on Debug variant, select (Debug) from Run and Debug menu. Likewise with Release.
        - Click the "Start Debugging" button or press F5.
        - If the build matches the launch configuration, Release shouldn't debug, but Debug will.

    * Note: If you just selected a variant, cmake ../.. is not needed.
